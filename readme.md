## Recap
### Higher Order Functions
- functions like data
    - Assign a function to a variable
    - Pass a function as an argument to another function
    - Return a function as a return value
### Deferred Functions
- Postpone the execution of a function until the current function execution completes
### Struct Composition
- Composition is how go implements "inheritance"
